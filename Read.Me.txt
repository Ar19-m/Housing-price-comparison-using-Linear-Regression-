#  Housing Price Prediction using Regression Models

##  Project Overview

This project performs a **comparative regression analysis** to predict housing prices using the Boston Housing dataset.
The goal is to evaluate and compare **linear** and **ensemble-based** regression models, analyse their predictive performance, and interpret **feature importance** to understand key socio-economic drivers of housing prices.

##  Objectives

* Build a **baseline Linear Regression model**
* Implement a **Gradient Boosting Regressor** for non-linear modelling
* Compare models using appropriate **regression metrics**
* Apply **cross-validation** to assess generalization
* Analyse and interpret **feature importance**
* Draw insights from agreement between linear and non-linear models

##  Dataset

* **Dataset**: Boston Housing Dataset
* **Target variable**: Median value of owner-occupied homes
* **Features** include socio-economic, environmental, and geographic indicators such as:

  * Average number of rooms (`RM`)
  * Percentage of lower-status population (`LSTAT`)
  * Crime rate (`CRIM`)
  * Nitric oxide concentration (`NOX`)
  * Accessibility to highways (`RAD`)



##  Models Implemented

1. **Linear Regression**

   * Interpretable baseline model
   * Captures global linear relationships

2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

   * Ensemble-based, non-linear model
   * Captures complex interactions and non-linear effects
   * Implemented using a pre-processing pipeline to avoid data leakage

## Evaluation Metrics

The models are evaluated using regression-appropriate metrics:

* **R² Score** (coefficient of determination)
* **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)

## 🔍 Feature Importance Analysis

Feature importance was analysed for both models:

### Linear Regression

* Coefficients indicate **direction and magnitude** of influence
* Provides interpretable, global relationships

### Gradient Boosting

* Importance based on split contribution
* Highlights dominant predictors in non-linear settings

### Key Findings:

* **LSTAT** (% lower-status population) and **RM** (average rooms per dwelling) dominate prediction
* Both linear and ensemble models identify similar top features
* Agreement across models indicates **stable and robust predictive signals**
* Other features contribute marginally once dominant variables are accounted for

## Insights & Interpretation

* Complex models do not always outperform simpler ones on small, structured datasets
* Similar feature rankings across models suggest strong underlying data structure
* Socio-economic indicators play a more significant role than purely geographic variables
* Model agreement increases confidence in interpretability and generalization

## Technologies Used

* Python
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit-learn


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete regression workflow—from baseline modelling to ensemble learning and interpretability—highlighting the importance of **model comparison**, **robust evaluation**, and **data-driven insights** in applied machine learning.
